## Computational Fluid Dynamics
Import the Aerofoil designed in Level 1. Task 2. a and simulate it in a wind tunnel using Autodesk CFD.
Calculate the lift force generated by the Aerofoil when the velocity of air flowing in the wind tunnel is 28ms^-1
Generate a report on it and furnish it in your report.

## Prototyping
### Sourcing & Materials Selection
Create a list of inventory required to make an electric bicycle
Parameters to keep in mind
Max weight`= 90kg
Max speed	= 40kmph
Max range	= 50km per charge
Furnish a detailed report for the same.

### Animation and rendering
  Design a Lego structure in Fusion 360 and use motion studies to animate the entire assembly. Use rendering option in fusion 360 to simulate various environments
Render the Lego man on a busy street with cobblestone texture.Prefer sunset timing.Try including some Soviet era tanks in the background.

## E L E C T R O N I C S
### Create A Voltage Multiplier!!
Voltage multiplier using capacitor pumps and a 555 Timer IC.
To do:
Pump up 9V to 18V at first, then cascade the pump to get 27V.
Use TinkerCad to design the required circuit

### Create a circuit that provides short-circuit protection.
A circuit when shorted can cause serious damage to the equipment. Create a circuit that provides the necessary protection.

### Logic design

Implement and design a full adder using 2x1 Multiplexers to generate sum and carry using open source circuit design software like CircuitVerse and document your implementation table

Resource: https://circuitverse.org/

### Filter Design

 Design a second order band pass filter using IC741 that amplifies the signal to roughly 1.5 times the original signal.Cutoff range between 4kHz and 10kHz. (Use LTspice)
