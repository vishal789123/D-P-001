##  Piston and crankshaft mechanism
![piston1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/591293c2-f4a4-4db6-b095-3ff3a4302fc0)


Design, manufacture, and analyze a piston and crankshaft mechanism. First, design each component (crankshaft, connecting rod, piston, etc.) in Fusion 360° software, ensuring proper dimensions. Assemble the components, creating a functional mechanism within the CAD environment, and perform a motion simulation to verify its operation. 
Generate G-code/NC code using CAM feature in fusion 360° for piston and crankshaft.

### Animation and rendering
  Design a Lego structure in Fusion 360 and use motion studies to animate the entire assembly. Use rendering option in fusion 360 to simulate various environments
Render the Lego man on a busy street with cobblestone texture.Prefer sunset timing.Try including some Soviet era tanks in the background.

## E L E C T R O N I C S
### Create A Voltage Multiplier!!
Voltage multiplier using capacitor pumps and a 555 Timer IC.
To do:
Pump up 9V to 18V at first, then cascade the pump to get 27V.
Use TinkerCad to design the required circuit

### Colpitts Chaos
Create a Colpitts oscillator circuit using an operational amplifier(IC747) to produce a sinusoidal waveform. Understand the behavior of an oscillator circuit and the role of feedback in sustaining oscillations. Generate a frequency of oscillation around 1 kHz.
Use LTspice for simulation.

### The Great Adder Escapade
Learn the basics of verilog and implement a 4 bit full adder by cascading 4 Full Adders, in the process do gate level modelling for each full adder. Write a testbench to simulate the same.
Use Vivado Design suite for implementing this task.
